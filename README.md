# PyNarcissus

PyNarcissus is a Javascript parser, and not a very Pythonic one
at that. Furthermore, documentation is poor.

Currently this is just a Javascript parser

this is a fork of pynarcissus by jtolds : https://github.com/jtolds/pynarcissus

forked for the sole purpose of printing the jtold's class structure in json
